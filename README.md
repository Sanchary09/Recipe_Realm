The Recipe Recommendation Application is an innovative platform
that enhances the culinary experience by enabling users to manage, discover, and explore a diverse range of recipes. The application
allows users to easily add, update, and delete personalized recipes, while categorizing them as vegetarian or non-vegetarian. A key
feature is its image recognition functionality, which uses a pretrained machine learning model to identify food items from
uploaded images and suggest relevant recipes. Additionally, it
integrates the Spoonacular API to generate recipe ideas based on
available ingredients, optimizing ingredient usage. Users can search
for specific recipes and access related cooking videos, making the
application a comprehensive tool for culinary exploration. Developed with modern web technologies such as Streamlit, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, the application ensures seamless accessibility
across various devices. This project aims to inspire culinary
creativity, improve cooking skills, and foster a connected
community of food enthusiasts.
